# bd-absolute-theme-repository
<h2>A personal and customized collection of themes for BetterDiscord, taken from multiple different themes, each with their respective credits and links to the original.</h2>

<b>To get this working, all you need to do is download the aio-master.theme.css file, which can be done by clicking on it, clicking "Raw" on the right side, just over where the file is displayed and then pressing Ctrl+S to save the file. You can name the file whatever you want when downloading it, but it is very important, however, that you make sure the filename contains "theme.css" at the very end, as it won't be recognised by BetterDiscord otherwise. When downloading, you also want to make sure it's put in the %APPDATA%/BetterDiscord/themes folder so BetterDiscord will include it in the "Themes" section in Discord. I hope you'll appreciate my effort of combining these great themes into one file for easier enabling/disabling.</b>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<b>Who would want to use this, when you can just download them separately?</b>
<br>
My AIO-theme might contain some themes you hadn't heard of or bothered to download yet. Since it contains multiple files, and you're free to add your own too, it allows for a faster disabling/enabling if you want to test new themes out and want to be sure nothing is affecting them.

<b>What if I want to add my own theme to the AIO file?</b>
<br>
You can probably get away with enabling it at the same time. If you want to include it in the AIO file, you can upload it to a code-hosting website like here on GitHub where you can copy the link and paste it in the file. If you do find something you wish was added to the file, you're more than welcome to create an issue where you can tell me about the theme and I'll try to include it.
