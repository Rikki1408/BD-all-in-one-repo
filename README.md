# bd-absolute-theme-repository
<h2>A personal and customized collection of themes for BetterDiscord, taken from multiple different themes, each with their respective credits and links to the original.</h2>

<b>What is this and why did I make it:</b><br>
This is essentially one theme file that loads multiple other theme files when enabled. If you're worried about it loading something you're not aware of, you can see exactly what it loads. All files were uploaded to this repository for the sake of saving any hassle if the original developers decide to move the file somewhere, which would break the URL reference within my theme file where it loads the actual themes. I made this so I wouldn't have to download and enable multiple diffrent themes when installing BetterDiscord, and this will instead allow me to just download and enable one file that loads everything I want. If you'd like to change anything about what it loads, you're completely free to do so.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<b>How to install:</b><br>
To get this working, all you need to do is download the aio-master.theme.css file, which can be done by clicking on it, clicking "Raw" on the right side, just over where the file is displayed and then pressing Ctrl+S to save the file. You can name the file whatever you want when downloading it, but it is very important, however, that you make sure the filename contains "theme.css" at the very end, as it won't be recognised by BetterDiscord otherwise. When downloading, you also want to make sure it's put in the %APPDATA%/BetterDiscord/themes folder so BetterDiscord will include it in the "Themes" section in Discord. I hope you'll appreciate my effort of combining these great themes into one file for easier enabling/disabling.

<b>Who would want to use this, when you can just download them separately?</b><br>
My AIO-theme might contain some themes you hadn't heard of or bothered to download yet. Since it contains multiple files, and you're free to add your own too, it allows for a faster disabling/enabling if you want to test new themes out and want to be sure nothing is affecting them.

<b>What if I want to add my own theme to the AIO file?</b><br>
You can probably get away with enabling it at the same time. If you want to include it in the AIO file, you can upload it to a code-hosting website like here on GitHub where you can copy the link and paste it in the file. If you do find something you wish was added to the file, you're more than welcome to create an issue where you can tell me about the theme and I'll try to include it.
